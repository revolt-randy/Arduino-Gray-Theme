# Arduino-Gray-Theme

A gray theme for the arduion IDE.

I usually work on arduino projects at the end of my day and the default IDE theme is just too harsh on my eyes during late night coding sessions. I tried a few of the available 'dark' themes and while they are dark, they are just too colorful and not much better than the default theme, IMO. So I've created a new gray theme for the arduino IDE:

I actually did not create this color scheme, I copied it from blender 3d's text editor.

There is one problem with this theme, and I can't change it. The line #'s and background are close to the same color and hard to read. The background color is the same color as the text editor, and the font color of the numbers can't be changed. That is this theme's downfall.....

# Installation:

## IDE v 1.8.6 and newer:
Locate your arduino sketchbook location - From the IDE, choose File -> Preferences. The sketchbook location is the first item in the preferences window, you can use the browse button to open the folder. Once the folder is open, if the directory 'theme' doesn't exsist, then create a new folder called 'theme' in the sketchbook directory. Download the theme-gray.zip file and place it in the new 'theme' directory. Now, close and restart the arduino IDE and choose File -> Preferences. You should now be able to select the new theme from the theme selection dialog. The IDE will need to be restarted again before the change is made.
